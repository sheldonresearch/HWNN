# News (June 27, 2025):
I am so glad to share that the advanced version of this model (with PyTorch) has been implemented and now integrated into the well-known hypergraph library: [EasyGraph](https://easy-graph.github.io)

You can directly access the source code of HWNN in the repository [Here HWNN](https://github.com/easy-graph/Easy-Graph/blob/pybind11/easygraph/model/hypergraphs/hwnn.py)

or you can use it in the EasyGraph framework via its sub-area tool: [EasyHypergraph](https://easy-graph.github.io/docs/hypergraph.html).


``easygraph.model.hypergraphs.hwnn``

In the near future, I will try to finish the code tutorial, usage example, etc to make this work impact more widely. (If you could help me finish this work, it would be greatly appreciated!)
